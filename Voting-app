root@ip-172-31-35-90:~/example-voting-app/k8s-specifications# kubectl get all .(pods displayed)
#Following are the observations:-
If we delete pods their replica will be created again.But when we delete db pod the result will not store in database.
In order to work result pod and data should store data permanently , I used the concept of PV(Persistent Volume) and  PVC(Persistent Volume Claim).
